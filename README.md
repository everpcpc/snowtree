# Snowtree

**AI generates code. You must review. You can't review all or rollback safely.**

Snowtree fixes this: **Worktree isolation + Incremental review + Stage as snapshot**.

## How It Works

**Isolated Worktrees** — Each AI session in its own worktree. Parallel, no conflicts.

**Native CLI** — Runs Claude Code, Codex directly. No wrapper.

**Incremental Review** — Review each round. Stage approved code. Next round, review diff only.

```
Round 1: AI codes → Review → Stage
Round 2: AI continues → Review diff → Stage
Round N: Done → Commit → Push PR
```

## Prerequisites

Snowtree calls AI coding agents directly via their CLI. Install at least one:
